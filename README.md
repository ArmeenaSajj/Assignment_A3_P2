This project includes two programs: Part A (unsynchronized) and Part B (synchronized with semaphores). Both programs use the same input files located inside their own exam_folder and read the marking scheme from rubric.txt. To compile each part, go into the folder (PartA or PartB) and run ./build.sh, which creates an executable named part2a or part2b. To run the programs, use ./part2a <num_TAs> or ./part2b <num_TAs> where <num_TAs> is the number of TA processes you want (minimum 2). The program loads exams in order from the exam folder and stops when it reaches the file containing the student ID 9999. Both parts behave the same, but Part B prevents race conditions using semaphores.
