During testing Part A did not fully deadlock, but there were noticeable race conditions that caused unpredictable execution ordering. Since the rubric and marking steps are not protected, multiple TA processes sometimes 
attempted to update the same data at the same time, which created brief periods where progress slowed or repeated work happened. This behavior is closer to livelock, but the program still eventually moved forward and reached 
the exam containing 9999. In Part B, after adding semaphores around the rubric updates, question marking, and exam loading we didn't observe any deadlock or livelock. The processes synchronized correctly, and the execution 
order became more orderly, with each TA waiting properly for access to shared sections.
